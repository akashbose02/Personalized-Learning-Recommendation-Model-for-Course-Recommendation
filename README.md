# Personalized-Learning-Recommendation-Model-for-Course-Recommendation
Personalized course recommendations are now crucial for improving learner engagement due to the enormous rise of online education platforms. Finding relevant courses that fit their interests, learning objectives, and existing skill levels can be difficult for students. These problems have been attempted to be addressed by conventional recommendation systems, such as content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. These approaches, however, have drawbacks when dealing with cold-start issues, sparse data, and dynamically changing user preferences. Collaborative filtering finds similarities between individuals or objects based on past interactions to produce suggestions. In situations with little user engagement, it operates poorly, even though it works effectively when there is enough data available. Conversely, by examining user preferences and course descriptions, content-based filtering suggests courses. Although useful for recommending contextually appropriate courses, it frequently results in recommendations that are not very diverse.

In order to address these drawbacks, this project suggests a hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. In order to automatically update user profiles and modify recommendations in response to fresh data, the system also integrates real-time adaption. As users' learning habits change, our method guarantees that recommendations stay pertinent and tailored.

The following are this project's main contributions:

Collaboration filtering and content-based filtering combined in a new hybrid recommendation system.

Epsilon-greedy algorithm for recommendation of courses.

Comparing the efficiency and results given by hybrid model (collaborative + content based filtering ) and epsilon-greedy algorithm.

Taking use of user preferences and content similarities to solve the cold-start issue.
